Overview
AR EchoQuests is a gamified, location-based feature that transforms augmented reality (AR) from a passive viewing experience into an emotionally rich and interactive storytelling platform. Designed with strong product thinking, EchoQuests makes AR engaging, repeatable, and personal by anchoring digital content (Echoes) to real-world locations and weaving them into guided quests.

The Problem Addressed
Many AR apps suffer from:

Shallow onboarding experiences that fail to retain users.

Lack of emotional hooks, making them forgettable.

Overwhelming creative freedom, leading to user paralysis.

Like how Instagram Reels outperformed IGTV by focusing on fun, quick, and shareable experiences, AR needs to shift from tech demo to meaningful interaction.
