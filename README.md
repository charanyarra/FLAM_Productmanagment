## 🚧 Problem Statement

Despite growing interest in AR, most applications struggle with user retention due to:

- Underwhelming first-time user experiences  
- Absence of emotional engagement or connection  
- Overly complex or unstructured creative tools  

These challenges hinder adoption and recurring usage of AR platforms.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution: AR EchoQuests

A unified feature set that transforms real-world environments into interactive, persistent AR experiences through:

### 🎮 Guided AR Quests
Structured, theme-based challenges to onboard users and encourage creative exploration.

Example quests:
- “Create an Echo that tells a story in your kitchen.”
- “Scan an object and animate it with AR.”

### 🔁 Streak & Reward System
Encourages daily engagement with:
- “Create 1 Echo a Day” challenges
- Unlockable Mystery Echoes, custom templates, and achievement badges

### ✨ Echo Creation
Users can create and anchor digital artifacts (“Echoes”) tied to physical locations, including:
- 3D objects
- Holograms
- Time-triggered animations

### 🗺 AR EchoMap
Visualizes the user’s AR footprint and displays public or selectively shared Echoes in a local context.
